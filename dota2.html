        <h1 class="text-left">What is DOTA2?</h1>
        <p>Dota 2 is a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve Corporation. The game is the stand-alone sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion pack, The Frozen Throne. Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character, known as a "hero", who all have unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, players collect experience points and items for their heroes in order to successfully battle the opposing team's heroes, who are attempting to do the same to them. A team wins by being the first to destroy a large structure located in the opposing team's base, called the "Ancient".</p>

        <h1 class="text-left">History</h1>
        <p>The Dota series began in 2003 with Defense of the Ancients (DotA)—a mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos—created by the pseudonymous designer "Eul". An expansion pack for Warcraft III, entitled The Frozen Throne, was released later that year; a series of Defense of the Ancients clone mods for the new game competed for popularity. DotA: Allstars by Steve Feak was the most successful, and Feak, with his friend Steve Mescon, created the official Defense of the Ancients community website and the holding company DotA-Allstars, LLC. When Feak retired from DotA: Allstars in 2005, a friend, under the pseudonym "IceFrog", became its lead designer. By the late 2000s, Defense of the Ancients became one of the most popular mods in the world, as well as a prominent eSports title. IceFrog and Mescon later had a falling out in May 2009, which prompted the former to establish a new community website at playdota.com.

Valve's interest in the Defense of the Ancients property began when several veteran employees, including Team Fortress 2 designer Robin Walker and producer Erik Johnson, became fans of the mod and wanted to build a modern sequel. The company corresponded with IceFrog by email about his long-term plans for the project, and he was subsequently hired to direct a sequel. IceFrog first announced his new position through his blog in October 2009, and Dota 2 was publicly announced by Game Informer in October 2010.</p>

        <h1 class="text-left">Why DOTA2?</h1>
        <p>
        Dota2 is a game in which players team up and then fight with another team. It suggests players to focus on teamwork --- a nice game to enjoy your time with friends. A single match in Dota2 usually take less than 40 minutes. As a result, it won't require you to invest tons of time in it. You can have fun in Dota2, even if you don't have much time for games. 
        
        At the same time, Dota2 can be a game to make a living. Dota2 is a totally free-to-play competitive game so that everyone is equally treated in this game. Due to its high competitivity, Dota2 attracts a lot of professional gamers, depending on it to make a living. They attend all kinds of Dota2 professional matches to earn the prize.

        <h1 class="text-left">More than just a game</h1>
        <p>The International (TI) is an annual Dota 2 eSports tournament hosted by Valve Corporation, the game's developer. In The International, thousands of teams coming from countries all over the world to fight for the incrediblely high prize: in The International 7, which was on August 2017, the prize pool reached its highest in history: $24,787,916. The winner of TI7, Team Liquid, won themselves $10,862,683 for winning the grand final. The first tournament took place in Cologne, Germany at Gamescom in 2011 and was held shortly after the public reveal of Dota 2, with a total prize pot of $1.6 million. The second International took place in 2012 at the Benaroya Hall in Seattle, and retained the same $1.6 million prize structure. For the third International in 2013, again at Benaroya Hall, Valve introduced an interactive, digital "compendium" which fans could purchase to follow the event and contribute to the prize pool; which reached a $2.8 million prize pool with $1.2 million added from compendium purchases.</p>


<p>Nowadays, professional players of Dota2 are training hard to fight for The International Series that takes place every year. Dota2 provides players a chance to make a different life; At the same time, it also contributes to the development of Esports. As more and more people are caring about Dota2 and its match series, it helps people to treat games seriously: they are not only boring games to kill your time. E-games can also show the spirit of fighting against hardship and building strong bonds with teammates, together with the good will of getting over the dilemma and improving yourself. I hope that, one day, E-games competition can be formally organized and seriously treated as the World Cup and NBA: it is the life style of young generation.</p>
